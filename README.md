# Stockx-Discord-Bot
This project is a discord bot that uses the Algolia search API to search products and uses that information in StockX's API to return data on a particular sneaker or piece of clothing.

# Motivation
The goal was to create something that people in the sneaker community would be able to use in their discord groups for free. Being able to visualize all the data on a sneaker at once without having to click and scroll is convenient and saves people time.

# Features
Takes in keywords from the user and displays a list of 10 possible products
- User can choose the desired product by reacting to the bot's message
  - If only 1 result is found, the user does not have to select an option

It returns an embed with:
- Product Name w/ StockX hyperlink
- Thumbnail Picture
- SKU
- Colorway
- Retail Price
- Release Date (yyyy-mm-dd)
- Highest Bid
- Lowest Ask
- Total Asks
- Total Bids
- Total Sold
- Sales in the last 72 hrs
- Table of lowest Ask and highest Bid for every size
